# Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill
levels. Eric Wastl made them and published them in the run-up to Christmas
2015, intended as a fun exercise for both new programmers and old hats who just
want to stay sharp. You can find them at adventofcode.com.

In this repo you can find my solutions to the puzzles, in Ruby. Solutions are
organised into folders by day, and each solution is self-contained in a source
file. Input is provided in the corresponding 'input' file and should be
piped into stdin. Only stdlib is used, no gems or special libraries needed.

You may also be interested in my C solutions, in the pizzeys/adventofcode repo.
